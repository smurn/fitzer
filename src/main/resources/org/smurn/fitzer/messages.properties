header value. Only spaces are allowed.

StringHeaderValueDoubleQuotes = Character string value in header must be \
enclosed by single quotation marks but double quotation marks are used.

enclosed by quotation marks. The closing quotation mark is missing.

StringHeaderValueInvalidChar = Character with ASCII code %1$d is not in the \
range of allowed characters (32 to, and including 126) for string header values.
