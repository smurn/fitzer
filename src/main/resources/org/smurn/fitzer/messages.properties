FitsFormatExceptionTest = Message with two parameters %1$d %2$d.

StringHeaderValueConverter_DecodeHighBit = Character in header value with code \
%1$d is outside of the range of ASCII characters. FITS only supports ASCII \
strings.

code %1$d is outside of the range of allowed ASCII characters. FITS only \
allows characters 32-126.
StringHeaderValueConverter_DecodeOpen = String value in header is missing \
closing single quote character.
